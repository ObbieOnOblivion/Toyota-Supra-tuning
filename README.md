This is my first application. I will use this to build my programming capability 

# Where? 
If you want to open this in pycharm, make sure that you put all of theses files in
the same folder. Make sure that folder contains a "venv" file and most likely a "__pycache__" file 

# How to run 
Click on the RunApp.py module. Then uncomment the dunder name == main code that fits your liking. 
The code that runs the use_screen() method is the application.
